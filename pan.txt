Came the voice of Destiny,
Calling o’er the Ionian Sea,
‘The Great God Pan is dead, is dead.
Humbled is the horned head;
Shut the door that hath no key –
Waste the vales of Arcady.’
Shackled by the Iron Age,
Lost the woodland heritage,
Heavy goes the heart of man,
Parted from the light-foot Pan;
Wearily he wears the chain
Till the Goat-god comes again.
Half a man and half a beast,
Pan is greatest, Pan is least,
Pan is all, and all is Pan;
Look for him in every-man;
Goat-hoof swift and shaggy thigh –
Follow him to Arcady.
He shall wake the living dead –
Cloven hoof and hornèd head,
Human heart and human brain,
Pan the goat-god comes again!
Half a beast and half a man –
Pan is all, and all is Pan.
Come, O Goat-god, come again!
